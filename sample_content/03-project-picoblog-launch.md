I'm thrilled to announce the launch of a new personal project: **picoblog**!

After needing a simple, no-fuss tool to generate a static website from a collection of Markdown files, I decided to build one myself using Rust. The goal was to create something fast, minimal, and easy to use, without a complex setup or a long list of dependencies.

### Key Features

*   **Blazing Fast:** Built with Rust for optimal performance.
*   **Single Page Output:** Generates one `index.html` file with all your posts.
*   **Tag Filtering:** Includes built-in support for tag generation and client-side filtering.
*   **Full-Text Search:** Creates a JSON index for client-side search functionality.
*   **URL Validation:** Enforces the use of absolute URLs for all images and links, ensuring no broken resources.
